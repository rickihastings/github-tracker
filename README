To install:

Dump install.sql into a database, upload commit-tracker.php to a webserver and add it as a post-recieve hook in your repo (isn't required, if it isnt added the bot won't track commits)
Configure github.php and run, enjoy.

Configure it in github.conf, repos are tracked via commands (dynamically in sql). Config file is parsed as json so comments arn't supported, sorry

Questions to Ricki @ irc.ircnode.org/#lobby

TODO:

Add support for re-opening issues (DONE)
Add support for closing? issues (DONE)
Add a :tracking command? Maybe.
Add debug logging to a file
Change :track and :untrack to pm only (DONE)
Add :join and :part (DONE)
Convert to V3 api (it's way better!) (DONE - converted everything but the main tracking command to v3, as v3 has pagination for that, which.. sucks)
